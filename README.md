# Simon-Say-Game

The Simon Says game is a fun and interactive game where you need to follow a sequence of actions. In this case, you have four colored buttons, and the game will show you a series of button presses. Your job is to remember and repeat that sequence correctly.

# Here's how to play the Simon Says game:

1. **Start the Game**: Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.

2. **Level Up**: The game will start at Level 1. The goal is to reach higher levels by successfully repeating longer sequences.

3. **Watch and Listen**: Pay close attention to the buttons that light up. Simon (the game) will show you a sequence by lighting up one or more buttons in a specific order. Remember this sequence.

4. **Repeat the Sequence**: After Simon shows you the sequence, it's your turn. Click on the buttons in the same order that you saw them light up. For example, if Simon lit up the blue button first and then the yellow button, you should click the blue button and then the yellow button.

5. **Check Your Answer**: After you click the buttons, the game will check if your sequence matches Simon's. If you get it right, you'll advance to the next level with a longer sequence.

6. **Game Over**: If you make a mistake and click the wrong button or click them in the wrong order, you'll lose the game. The game will display your score (the level you reached) and invite you to start over.

7. **Restart**: If you want to play again, just press any key on your keyboard to start a new game.

The challenge in Simon Says is to see how far you can get by remembering and repeating longer and longer sequences. It's a game of memory and concentration. Have fun playing!
